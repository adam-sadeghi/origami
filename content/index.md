Hi, my name is Adam. My interests include computer science, philosophy, history and self-improvement. Also games, sci-fi, and anime, in case that sounded too pretentious. This [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) is meant to contain notes on some of the topics that I feel comfortable exposing to the public. I do not expect anyone else to actually read them, my primary motivation is to retell the information in my own words to better grasp and internalize it.

> When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. It is the same as the pupil, in learning to write, following with his pen the lines that have been pencilled by the teacher. Accordingly, in reading, the work of thinking is, for the greater part, done for us.

\- Arthur Schopenhauer, On Reading and Books

Should one read news and keep up to date on global affairs?

I'm naturally curious, so for a long time I would have answered yes. After all, I already read books on history and politics. Adding newspapers to the mix seems like a slam dunk. Many positives of reading news are clear. Information is necessary to be a good, active citizen. How will you defend from misinformation, if you keep yourself in the dark? Or how will you feel when your friends discuss the latest scandal, of which you haven't even heard? Some of these reasons have merit, but many are a product of a fear of missing out.

At one point, I started questioning the benefits of consuming news regularly. Writings by Cal Newport, [this article](https://fs.blog/stop-reading-news/) and other sources highlighted that news have many negatives as well. Vast majority is ephemeral and does not matter the next day, let alone next month. The time could thus be spent better, be it productively or on more useful hobbies. As the next step, I tried to [[Focus|focus]] on a more deliberate, researched news coverage. I landed on the weekly magazine, The Economist, which I have read for a few years. While it alleviated some issues and many long-form articles and briefings were excellent, there were still at least two big problems left:
1. Lack of coverage for local and national topics.
2. Time required to read the bloody thing every week.

With a mind to fix these points, I had recently stopped reading The Economist and replaced it with two separate sources. Before I talk about them, let me quickly summarise the goals I hope to achieve with the current or any subsequent set ups:
- Thoughtful, well-researched coverage and analysis of the most important global and local affairs. The more ephemeral news should be filtered out.
- No undue time requirements to keep current. Half an hour a day, few times a week should be enough.

The first source is a local podcast [Studio N](https://denikn.cz/podcast-studio-n/), which covers both global and local affairs, is usually well-researched and invites interesting guests. Listening to it also doesn't exacerbate the time issue, as I can listen to it on the road or when doing chores. The second publication, which I discovered only recently, is a quarterly magazine [Delayed Gratification](https://www.slow-journalism.com/). It covers global news from the previous three months with the benefit of hindsight. While I still absorb many current news by osmosis, through friends, randomly playing radio etc., I try to eliminate all other sources to improve my focus, which has admittedly suffered over the years from the barrage of constant news and social media. Time to grow it back.
